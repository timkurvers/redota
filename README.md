# Background

This is an experiment to revisit past Dota 2 matches in the browser, fully relying
on parsing replays client-side without any server involvement.

ReDota can download these replay files from Valve through a [replay proxy].

Contributions in form of issues, feedback or pull requests more than welcome!

# Attribution

ReDota is a heavily derived project and stands on the shoulders of giants, notably
parsers by [Dotabuff] and [Skadistats].

Special thanks to community members from [OpenDota] and [ModDota] who assisted in
deciphering replay specifics.

# Setup & Development

ReDota is written in [ES2020+], powered by [MobX] and [React], styled with [styled-components],
modularized using [ECMAScript modules] and bundled with [webpack].

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone git://github.com/timkurvers/redota.git
   ```

2. Download and install [Node.js] 14+ for your platform.

   **Note**: If you plan on using ReDota's parser programatically, please note that Node.js 17+ is
   currently [not supported][#70].

3. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Compile Valve's game message definitions to a format ReDota can work with:

   ```shell
   npm run build:protos
   ```

   **Note**: This step only needs to be done once, or when the definitions themselves change.

5. Run the dev server on `http://localhost:8080` which automatically monitors source files:

   ```shell
   npm run start:dev
   ```
