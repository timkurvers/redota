# Background

This is an experiment to revisit past Dota 2 matches in the browser, fully relying
on parsing replays client-side without any server involvement.

ReDota is a heavily derived project and stands on the shoulders of giants,
notably parsers by [Dotabuff], [OpenDota] and [Skadistats].

# Status

Currently, ReDota is capable of parsing replays and playing back in real time.
It does not yet parse everything correctly though.

# Legalese

- Dota 2 is a registered trademark of [Valve Corporation].
- Image resources, lore and other references are property of [Valve Corporation].
- The Dota 2 map background originates from [Gamepedia].

# Setup & Development

Rest of this README soon ;)
